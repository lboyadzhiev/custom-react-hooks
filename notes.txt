What & Why?

    What is custom hook: 

        Outsource stateful loin into re-usable functions.

    Why:

        Unlike 'regular functions', custom hooks can use other React hooks and React state.

    

Building a Custom Hook

    We will start by creating a 'hooks' folder next to components folder, and in ther we can create our hooks files - ex 'use-counter.js';
    The name of the file depends on us, but we follow a rule, to be exactly as a fucntion that we will create inside the file, and the functions inside MUST start with 'useCounter';


    !!!! If we use a custom hook in multiple components, every comonent will received it's own state.

    Custom hooks can receive an arguments, and in this way we can do it reusable.
